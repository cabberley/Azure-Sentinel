# Okta SSO Data Connector

This folder currently has 2 versions of the Okta SSO Data Connector. The original and an updated Version 2 (V2) which addresses several issues with the original release.

To update to the new version, please either 
1. Delete your original Okta SSO Azure Function and redeploy the version 2
2. Alternatively you can edit your existing Azure Function and manually replace the Azure Function code and revise your Azure Function Application settings.

NOTE: Version 2 does make changes to Requirements.psd1, so please review all files in the folder if you choose to manually update.
